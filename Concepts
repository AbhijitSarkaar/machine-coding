Notes:
1. When appending an element, elements are created in the js file using document.createElement api
2. an element is available to the javascript file only after it's parsed

Roadblocks faced

1. Not able to add events.
=> Worked using getElementById. Not working using getElementsByClassName. getElementsByClassName returns a list of html elements.

2. Should same ids be used?
=> Ids should not be names multiple times. it should be unique. getElementById returns the first element with the given id

3. Not able to attach handlers to dynamicaly created elements
=> one way to solve it is adding the handlers inside the constructor. Another way to solve it is to use event delegation.
i.e attach the event handler on a parent container and when the event passes down to that element, call the required function

4. how to remove a element from a list? basically how to locate the item selected? index??
=> Add the remove functionality on the constructor

5. linking js file not working
=> add async attribute in the script file or place the script tag after the body. 
putting script tag after the body creates the document object and then adds the events. async attributes lets the html parsing
to continue while downloading the script file
