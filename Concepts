Notes:
1. When appending an element, elements are created in the js file using document.createElement api


Roadblocks faced

1. Not able to add events.
=> Worked using getElementById. Not working using getElementsByClassName. getElementsByClassName returns a list of html elements.

2. Should same ids be used?
=> Ids should not be names multiple times. it should be unique. getElementById returns the first element with the given id

3. Not able to attach handlers to dynamicaly created elements
=> one way to solve it is adding the handlers inside the constructor. Another way to solve it is to use event delegation.
i.e attach the event handler on a parent container and when the event passes down to that element, call the required function

4. how to remove a element from a list? basically how to locate the item selected? index??
=> Add the remove functionality on the constructor
